The LA portion of things went perfectlysmooth and professional. The band was thrilled with the final productand so was I.

Hybrid simply DAW. Warren Huart: My Transition to Digital Recording I went the hybrid route early, in the late 1990s and purely out of necessity. Like most people of my generation, I started out on tape. In my case, a 1 Tascam MSR-24 with DBX. Eventually, technology moved on and I acquired an ADAT (digital tape) machine before progressing to modern digital audio workstations on computer, with a Factor A8 I/O. There wasnt a lot of gear or the bells and whistles available on the digital front at the time. What was available was simply out of a reasonable price range for me. I had a Soundtracs Topaz console and later a TAC Scorpion console, a kind of AMEK clone. Then I began to add some pieces like the early BAE mic preamplifiers. I had to figure out a way to integrate this gear because while I could track audio with the TAC, I didnt want to mix with it. I didnt trust the colour that it added to the sound. What I started doing was using Pro Tools for the heavy lifting, but here and there I would send a signal out for processing and bring it back into the mix. Perhaps an 1176 on a vocal chain set to 20:1 to limit at the end of my compression and EQ chain inside of Pro Tools. It sounded fantastic. I began to selectively send four or five elements of a primarily in the box mix out to hardware, and it really did make a difference. I was competing with pros who were mixing with their large-scale SSL consolesme, with my computer, TAC console and hybrid approach out of pure necessity, and I was getting great results, getting work and keeping up. I love vintage gear. I have been lucky enough over the years to acquire a number of pieces that have become an essential part of my sound, such as Pultec equalisers, UA 1176 compressors, Teletronix LA-2A limiters and more. I also love modern tools plugins and virtual instruments and amp modellers, mic modellers. The only way I can put all these pieces to work is in a hybrid environment. In my setup, the interface is my SSL 4000 G console, which I route to Pro Tools. Mind you, were looking at the recording process here production work. The process of bringing audio into a session for use later in a mix and a finished recording. When it comes to mixing, the core value to a hybrid approach in my thinking is the ability to bring select pieces of hardware into a mix chain that Warren at his original Swing House Studio in Hollywood are not available digitally. 24",580,3258

A Deeper Look at a Few Free DAWs A number of free DAWs allow you to accomplish quite a bit with minimal setup. Some of the software is fully featured.  Cakewalk by BandLab. Cakewalk is favoured by EDM producers and creators, though its serious functionality is by no means limited to one genre. This 64-bit, Windows-based offering features a fully customisable interface and unlimited audio, MIDI, instrument, loop and auxiliary tracks in every project. It supports VST3 and Touch technologies.  Cubase LE. Steinbergs Cubase LE is a free lite version of Cubase Pro. The software supports sixteen audio tracks, up to twenty-four MIDI tracks for external instruments and up to eight instrument tracks for virtual instruments. The software also comes with the HALion Sonic SE, a flexible sound production tool that includes a large sample library, a synthesiser engine and effects. Also included is the Groove Agent SE drum production tool. With eighteen core plugins from EQ and compression to time-based effects, youll have everything you need out the gate.  PreSonus Studio One Prime. Theres the good and the not so good when it comes to free DAWs. PreSonuss free offering isnt quite as robust as other software, compared to its commercial versions. In a number of key areas, it either doesnt provide functionality or limits it. The primary restriction here is a two-in/two-out I/O restriction. Only ten plugins are offered as well, which is pretty meagre considering the next step up in their product line comes with thirty-two of them. Third-party plugins are not supported at all.  Apple GarageBand. If you own an Apple computer or mobile device, you also own GarageBand. For no cost, its a surprisingly capable DAW. As a stripped-down version of their Logic Pro X professional DAW, GarageBand is the perfect place to tinker with tracking, MIDI and mixing before taking the plunge with weightier software.

Creativity doesnt come to a halt when youre away from the studio. Numerous music production apps exist for mobile devices such as iPads and Android tablets. One of the challenges of app-based audio tools is that they tend to be specialised.

You might need one app for recording and mixing, and yet another for sequencing and MIDI composition.

Add another 10 times of loudness (20 dB), and now the sound is 100 times louder than silence (because we are dealing with magnitude). Dynamics refers to the decibel (dB) variations in a piece of audio, the volume of audio (loud or soft), or some combination of both. The difference between the loudest section of a piece of audio and the quietest is called the dynamic range. Further, dynamics can occur over long or short periods of time.

When getting together your packing list for the gig, be prepared for as many eventualities as you can anticipate. Take a range of cables and adapters, especially for your recording interface and even if you are taking a feed from the FOH console. Extension power cords are a must as well. You just never know how far away from a power source youre going to be. Once at the venue, set up your own audience mics to capture the room and overall ambience. A direct feed from the stage mics rarely has this kind of spill, and a live recording always needs to include the energy of a cheering audience before or after a song. Consider bringing a backup system for recording. The worst thing that can happen is the DAW dropping outand the worst thing happens from time to time. Ideally, the backup system is associated with a separate signal chain. For instance, your main recording system is connected to the FOH console, while your backup system is connected to the foldback or monitoring system. In this scenario, should there be any problem with the connection to the primary console, you could pull in the foldback signal, which is identical. Live performance recording can use stage-box splitter snakes, where the signals from the stage are sent both to the FOH console and to a series of mobile preamps linked to digital systems, including foldback monitoring and workstation software. Having a breakout and your own preamps allows you much more control over the recorded signal because you are bypassing the EQ and other settings associated with the FOH sound that are applied to generate a good live sound. Those requirements may be in conflict with a good sound for the recording. This level of sophistication is by no means standard, however. Sometimes capturing 146",385,2237

If the musicians you are working with have a unique sound that serves as a signature of sorts, any preference you personally may have should always be secondary to what best serves the artist. For instance, if the drummer has great feel, you dont want to squash it with compression all those dynamics are why the player is great in the first place. In those situations, a little touch of compression on the snare top and the kick drums inside mic will tighten things without killing the dynamics. Thinking about piling on the compression when working with a super-dynamic jazz drummer? Dont even. Always keep in mind that your use of EQ and especially dynamics in recording the dominant instruments of your arrangement (drums, bass, guitars, keys) will impact how other instruments must be recorded to fit in and be heard. When it comes to music that is a blend of organic and virtual instruments, the dynamic ranges can be mismatched completely, and the sounds wont work together. Wall-of-amps guitars dont sit well with jazz drums. Dynamic acoustic guitars dont tend to sit well with in- your-face virtual drums. In either case, adding some compression to even out the relationship between sounds will not only improve the balance but also allow the musician to approach their work more naturally, because they wont be trying to compete with the louder, less dynamic elements. With all that said, some decisions you can make in recording arent necessary. If youre considering squashing up room mics with compression to develop some secondary energy, for example, you can easily do this in the mixing phase too. 208",283,1689

Secondary kick drum microphones are very popular with recording engineers. These mics are used in a variety of ways. They can reinforce the primary microphone when placed in phase- aligned combination with it, or they can pick up transient tones if independently placed. A favourite location is using a secondary mic to capture the drum beater head, providing a lot of definition to the kick attack. Specialised low-frequency microphones like the DW Moon Mic or the Yamaha Subkick are specifically designed to capture frequencies below 100 Hz and are popular choices in a secondary kick drum microphone.

Most seasoned engineers will tell you to locate them based on Tom-Toms how the drummer plays and sets up their kit. A hard-hitting drummer may sound better with a microphone placed farther away from the drumhead than one that is close in, and vice versa for a more dynamic player. Because most snares are nestled between the hi-hat, kick drum and rack tom-tom, a core requirement of any mic placement is that it doesnt interfere with a kits playability. Commonly, the top snare microphone is pointed at the middle of the drum and positioned somewhere between the centre of the snare and the rim. Note that the tone captured is also related to the height of the microphone from the snare head. Lower heights create tighter tones with less ring compared to the looser, more resonant tones produced with a mic placed a few inches over the head.

Both dynamic and condenser microphones are completely capable of capturing a great tone from your tom-toms. With that in mind, dynamic mics such as the Beyer 201, Sennheiser 421 and Shure SM57 as well as condenser mics such as the AKG C 414, Neumann U 67 and Neumann KM 84 will all do admirably. One consideration in choosing microphones for the toms is drummers preferred cymbal height. Low cymbal heights make placement of larger mics difficult. Placement for tom-tom mics follows the guidelines for other drums. Commonly, you can start with the mic 5 to 20 centimetres (2 to 8 inches) above the head and 2.5 to 5 centimetres (1 to 2 inches) inside the rim. Angling and Hi-hat mic placement aiming the mic at the centre of the head will get you a tone with the most attack transients.

The design also means the polarity of the first coil is cancelled by the second, silencing the noise from the pickup (bucking the hum). Active pickups use fewer coils than their passive cousins, making them quieter, though they produce less output.

The frequencies beyond the cutoff are rolled off, following a predetermined curve based on decibels per octave (dB/oct). (Some filters offer multiple curves, such as Butterworth, Bessel, Chebyshev [Type I and II], Elliptical and Resonant Butterworth.) Common curves are 6, 12, 18 and 24 dB/oct. Shelving filters allow for the boosting or cutting of A band-pass filter frequencies above or below a certain frequency by a fixed gain amount. Band-pass filtering combines high- and low-passing into one, allowing you to roll off frequencies above and below a centre frequency at either a fixed or an adjustable rate of decibels per octave. High- and low-pass filtering and shelving are features found in many equalisers in either a fixed mode or a switchable mode, typically combined with bell EQ features, though it is rare to find the features in a stand-alone hardware unit.

You can run into a lot of problems with a heavily compressed two-track and a very dynamic vocal performance. The vocal either will be buried by the backing track or will hover obviously above the mix. Rather than burying the vocal underneath a dense instrumental, work towards the vocals sitting just above the instrumental. Staged compression will help in this regard. Compress in small increments until the vocals density starts to match that of the instrumental. Pay close attention to the instrumentals overall tonality. It might be very bright, very dark or somewhere in the middle. Complementing the instrumentals quality with your vocal EQ will do wonders for gluing everything together. For example, a dark vocal on a bright track might sound a little buried, or a bright vocal on a dark track might not sound cohesive. This goes for other instrumental qualities toonot just EQ. For example, a popular trend in the trap genre has been heavily distorted 808s.

Many reverb plugins have this parameter, and it functions by separating the dry signal from the wet signal via a user-set time interval, meant to represent the early reflection of sound off of the nearest surface. By properly adjusting pre-delay, the space and dimension is gained from the reverb without pushing the dry vocal into the recesses of the mix. Using Artificial Double-Tracking Double-tracking is almost as old as recording itselfduplicating a performance creates interesting phase relationships between the original and doubled performance and is especially nice on vocals. Tools such as Waves Doubler and Reel ADT can give a single vocal performance that double-tracked feel. Waves Doubler uses delay and pitch modulation (chorusing) to automatically add texture and richness to a single track, while Reel ADT replicates EMI Studios famed Artificial Double Tracking (ADT) hardware setup invented by Ken Townsend for John Lennon.

A handful of plugin reverbs, such as IK Multimedias T-RackS Sunset Sound Studio Reverb, combine both IR and algorithmic approaches. Reverb creates a sense of space for the listener. A single reverb creates a single space; two reverbs will create two spaces or can be used in unison. You can also use multiple reverbs as an effect (see below), but its very easy to lose cohesion in the mix when reverbs are defining conflicting spaces in the listeners ears. Too much reverb or too many competing reverbs can cause problems with overlapping reflections that create confusion for listeners. The majority of mixers use auxiliary buses to add reverb to their signals.

Plate Reverb Plate reverb was one of the first types of artificial reverb to be developed. It worked by suspending a steel plate under tension with springs at the corners and then attaching that plate to an outer shell. The plate would vibrate after receiving a signal from a transducer (an input signal), and that vibration would subsequently be picked up by another microphone in the unit Waves Abbey Road Chambers plugin (the output signal).

Guitars and keyboards Cabinet are typical input sources, though pretty much anything can be routed through an amplifier and a cabinet. The following pages cover a series Recording of classic miking approaches to recording live cabinets as well as a handful of techniques from Techniques some top pro engineers. 412",66,424

Keep this fact in mind Floor coupling happens with cabinets when when approaching any miking technique. frequencies are transferred to the floor from a cabinet placed directly on it, but the impact this has on a close-miked recorded signal is much different than what is experienced on a stage in a live performance. Elevating your cabinet or isolating it from the ground via a riser or other device is not known to make any measurable difference in the negative resonance of the cabinet. Those in favour of elevating cabinets believe they are reducing low-end mud and increasing midrange clarity. Beatles engineer Norman Smith often elevated their VOX amplifiers when recording. In the end Identifying the sweet spot on an amplifier cabinet there is no right answer to thisuse your ears. It is key to getting a great sound. might be that elevating helps your sound. When using multiple mics, its critical to pay Techniques attention to their phase relationship. This is achieved by ensuring that the capsules (or Single-Mic Techniques ribbons) are at the same distance from the sound source. Remember that the microphones Mike Plotnikoff cap or windscreen does not represent the location of the capsule. They are meant to protect the capsule. If available, always record a DI of the amplifier. This gives you the flexibility to re-amp or simply to use the transients from the DI to articulate a tone more precisely.
